PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a method of varying the width of the pulses in a pulse train to encode a signal or to control the power delivered to a load. PWM is widely used in applications such as motor control, dimming LEDs, and voltage regulation.

Duty Cycle: This is the percentage of time the signal remains high (logic '1') within a single period. For example, a 50% duty cycle means the signal is high for half the time and low for the other half.
2. PWM Design (pwm.v):
I will refer to the uploaded file for the PWM design code to describe it.

In general, a PWM module design typically involves:

A counter that continuously increments with every clock cycle.
A comparison logic that compares the current counter value with a duty cycle value. When the counter is less than the duty cycle, the PWM output is high; otherwise, it's low.

Explanation:

Parameters:
WIDTH: The width of the counter and duty cycle input. It sets the resolution of the PWM (e.g., 8-bit PWM can represent 256 levels of duty cycle).
Inputs:
clk: The clock signal driving the module.
rst_n: Active low reset to reset the counter and output.
duty: The desired duty cycle value (between 0 and 255 for an 8-bit design).
Output:
pwm_out: The PWM signal output.
Counter Logic:
A counter increments with every clock edge. When it reaches its maximum value (255 for 8-bit), it resets to 0.
PWM Logic:
The pwm_out signal is set high when the counter is less than the duty cycle, and low otherwise.

3. Testbench (pwm_tb.v):
The testbench is designed to simulate and verify the behavior of the PWM module.
Explanation:

Parameters:
R: Bit-width of the duty cycle, set to 8 in this case.
T: Period of the clock in simulation time units.
Signals:
clk: The clock signal toggling every T/2 time units.
rst_n: Active-low reset signal.
duty: The duty cycle being tested, varying between 25%, 50%, and 75%.
pwm_out: Output of the PWM module.
Clock Generation:
A simple clock generation is done by toggling the clk signal every T/2 time units.
Test Stimulus:
The test begins by asserting a reset (rst_n = 0), then releases it after 2-time units (rst_n = 1).
The duty cycle is set to 25%, 50%, and 75%, with a wait period (controlled by repeat) to observe the changes in the pwm_out signal.
Termination:
The simulation stops after (7*2**R*T) time units, giving enough time for the waveform to stabilize.

4. Pros and Cons of PWM:
Pros:
Efficiency: PWM signals are efficient for controlling power in devices, especially motors, as energy loss is minimal.
Precision: With high-resolution counters, you can control the duty cycle very precisely.
Simplicity: PWM signals are simple to generate and use in control applications like dimming or motor speed regulation.
Cons:
Switching Noise: Rapid changes in signal levels can introduce noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI), which needs to be filtered.
Switching Losses: In power electronics, each switch event introduces small losses, which can accumulate in high-frequency applications.

5. Applications of PWM:
Motor Speed Control: By varying the duty cycle, you can control the speed of DC motors in robotics and industrial systems.
LED Dimming: PWM is widely used in LED dimming applications, where brightness is controlled by changing the duty cycle.
Audio Signal Generation: PWM can be used to generate audio tones by modulating the duty cycle at different frequencies.
Power Supplies: PWM is used in switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) to control the output voltage efficiently.

6. Simulation Tool:
Tool Used: ModelSim (for waveform analysis).
Editor: Gvim (for writing and editing Verilog code).
To view the waveforms in ModelSim, you'll compile the testbench, run the simulation, and analyze the pwm_out signal across different duty cycles to ensure it behaves as expected for each test case (25%, 50%, 75% duty cycles).
