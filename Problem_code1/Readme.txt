Problem Statement
You are tasked with designing a combinational circuit based on the provided requirements. The output should be 1 when the input variables contain more 1s than 0s, and 0 otherwise. This requires identifying the truth table, deriving the Boolean equation, and developing a logic diagram.

Design Description
Module pc1:
Inputs: a, b, c, d (4 binary input variables)
Output: y (binary output)
Logic: The circuit uses intermediate wires to handle the internal logic operations such as AND and OR operations.
AND and OR operations:

The circuit uses several and and or gates to derive intermediate signals. These are stored in a 6-bit wire array g.
First, the and gates combine pairs of inputs (a, b and c, d), and their results are combined through or gates.
The final result is computed using a combination of the intermediate results and assigned to the output y.
Purpose: The logic of this design determines if there are more 1s than 0s in the inputs.

Testbench pc1_tb:
Purpose: The testbench is written to validate the correctness of the pc1 design.
Signals: The testbench declares input signals a, b, c, and d, which are randomly assigned values using $urandom_range.
Monitoring: It uses $monitor to observe the changes in inputs and the corresponding output y during each iteration.
Repetition: The repeat(20) loop executes for 20 cycles, each time generating random inputs and displaying the corresponding output.
Ending simulation: After 150 time units, the simulation finishes using $finish.
Tools Used
Simulation: The code was executed using ModelSim, a popular simulation tool for Verilog/SystemVerilog designs. It allows for simulating the behavior of the pc1 module and verifying the results of the testbench. The output waveform and results show whether the logic correctly implements the intended behavior.
Editing: The code was written using Gvim text editor, a highly customizable text editor suited for programming and used here for editing Verilog code.
Execution Flow
Editing: The Verilog design and testbench were written and edited using the Gvim text editor.
Simulation: The ModelSim tool was used to compile the code and simulate the circuit behavior.
Monitoring Output: The testbench shows the output y for different combinations of inputs (a, b, c, d). The output values confirm whether the circuit operates as expected based on the given problem statement. For instance, the testbench shows that the output y is 1 only when there are more 1s than 0s among the input variables.
This combinational circuit design and its verification process demonstrate how Boolean logic is implemented using Verilog, and how tools like ModelSim are employed to validate the functionality through simulations.
