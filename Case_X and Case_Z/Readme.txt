In Verilog, casex and casez are variations of the case statement, which is used for making decisions based on the value of an expression. They extend the functionality of the basic case statement by introducing ways to handle "don't care" bits, which are useful in designing hardware where certain bit positions may not be relevant for decision-making.

casex:
casex allows the use of "don't care" conditions (X or Z) in both the case expression and the case item values. When casex is used, the X or Z bits in the expression and case items are treated as "don't care," meaning they can match either 0 or 1.

Pros:
Flexibility: casex is flexible in matching conditions that involve X or Z bits. This is useful when the logic doesn't depend on certain bit positions, allowing designers to ignore them.
Simplified design: When dealing with multi-bit signals where some bits are irrelevant, casex simplifies the design by allowing wildcards in comparisons.
Cons:
Risk of unintended matches: Since both X and Z are treated as don't care, unintended matches can occur, leading to potential bugs or incorrect behavior.
Simulation vs. Synthesis: casex behavior in simulation might differ from its synthesis. It can cause synthesis tools to generate hardware that doesnâ€™t behave as intended, as synthesis typically tries to avoid X or Z values.
Unpredictable in simulation: In simulation, X values can propagate and cause the design to behave unexpectedly, especially if not handled properly.
Applications:
casex is useful when designing decoders, state machines, or when the input signal might contain unknown states (X or Z). It simplifies the design when some bits can be ignored, or "don't care" conditions need to be accounted for.
Good for creating partial decoders where only certain bits need to be checked.
casez:
casez is another variation of the case statement that allows Z bits (high-impedance) in the expression and case items to be treated as "don't care." Unlike casex, only Z bits are treated as wildcards, while X bits are still considered valid values (and hence do not act as wildcards).

Pros:
Selective don't care: It provides a more controlled version of wildcard matching, as only Z values are treated as don't care, making it safer than casex in some situations.
Closer to synthesis expectations: casez is generally safer than casex for synthesis, as most synthesis tools treat Z values properly, and designers avoid X propagation issues.
Better predictability: It is less likely to cause unpredictable behavior during simulation, since only Z values are wildcards, not X.
Cons:
Limited application: Since only Z is treated as a wildcard, it is less flexible than casex. If the design involves unknown (X) values, it will not behave as expected.
Synthesis complications: Although safer than casex, it still might lead to complications during synthesis if Z values are not properly accounted for in the design process.
Applications:
casez is often used when designing multiplexers, decoders, or state machines where certain signal values are not relevant, but only Z values should be treated as "don't care."
Useful in situations where high-impedance states need to be handled explicitly without ignoring X values.

Comparison of casex and casez:
Wildcards:

casex: Treats both X and Z as don't care.
casez: Treats only Z as don't care.
Flexibility:

casex: More flexible (due to X and Z being wildcards).
casez: Less flexible (only Z is a wildcard).
Predictability:

casex: Less predictable in simulation (due to X as don't care).
casez: More predictable in simulation (since only Z is don't care).
Synthesis:

casex: Can cause issues in synthesis (due to X as don't care).
casez: Safer for synthesis (since X is not treated as don't care).
Use Case:

casex: Useful for partial matching (decoders, state machines, etc.).
casez: Suitable for handling high-impedance (Z) conditions (muxes, decoders, etc.).

When to use casex vs casez:
casex is suitable for designs where both unknown (X) and high-impedance (Z) values need to be treated as don't care. It is primarily useful for abstract design, but the designer must be careful about synthesis implications.
casez is more appropriate when only high-impedance values need to be ignored, making it a safer choice in most practical hardware designs, especially during synthesis.
Summary:
casex and casez are powerful extensions of the case statement in Verilog, useful when designing hardware where certain bits can be ignored.
casex treats both X and Z as don't care, providing flexibility but with potential pitfalls in simulation and synthesis.
casez treats only Z as don't care, making it safer and more predictable for synthesis, especially in real-world hardware implementations.
Choosing between casex and casez depends on the design requirements and the need to account for unknown states versus high-impedance states.
